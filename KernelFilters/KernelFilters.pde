KERNEL FILTERS
 Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org
 
 A filter that looks at its neighbors can be very useful,
 since a single pixel in context doesn't tell us a whole lot.
 If we add in the idea of weighted changes based on the
 neighboring pixels, we call this a "kernel" filter.
 
 Kernel filters can be used for lots of things, but they're
 often used for things like blurring, which average pixels in
 a region, and edge detection (the opposite).
 
 More info and some example kernels here:

 https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-convmatrix.html
 
 CHALLENGES:
 + Try changing the kernel to match some of the ones listed
   in the links above â€“ can you get a simple edge detection 
   working? Can you expand our kernel from 3x3 to 5x5?
